## DB-AAE (Adversarial Autoencoder with dynamic batching )
### Abstract

By revealing the transcriptome of individual cells, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers insights into cellular heterogeneity and disease mechanisms. However, challenges such as low capture rates and dropout events can introduce noise in data analysis. Here, we propose a generative framework, the dynamic batching adversarial autoencoder (DB-AAE), which excels at denoising in scRNA-seq datasets. DB-AAE directly captures optimal features from input data and enhances feature preservation, including cell type-specific gene expression patterns. Comprehensive evaluation on simulated and real datasets demonstrates that DB-AAE outperforms other methods in denoising accuracy and biological signal preservation. It also improves the accuracy of other algorithms in establishing pseudo-time inference. This study highlights DB-AAE's effectiveness and potential as a valuable tool for enhancing the quality and reliability of downstream analyses in scRNA-seq research.
